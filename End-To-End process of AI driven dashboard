ðŸš€ Introduction
In this project, I leveraged AI tools, including ChatGPT, to streamline the entire data pipelineâ€”from data extraction to an interactive sales performance dashboard. This approach showcases how AI can automate and enhance data analytics workflows, making insights accessible and actionable.

ðŸ“Œ Step 1: Data Extraction from an External Website
The first step was to acquire sales data from an external website. Instead of manually copy-pasting, I used AI-assisted data extraction to collect structured information efficiently.

âœ… Extracted raw data into CSV format.
âœ… Identified inconsistencies and missing values.

ðŸ“Œ Step 2: Data Cleaning with AI Tools
To clean and refine the data, I utilized ChatGPT and AI-powered Excel tools to automate transformations.

âœ… Removed duplicate and null values.
âœ… Standardized inconsistent data formats.
âœ… Created two new columns:

CreditHealth: Categorized customers based on Credit Score.
AgeCategory: Grouped customers into Youth, Adult, and Senior segments.

ðŸ“Œ Step 3: Converting CSV to JSON for Visualization
Since JSON is more suitable for web-based visualizations, I converted the cleaned CSV file into JSON format using ChatGPTâ€™s guidance and Excel scripts.

âœ… Ensured proper JSON structure with readable headers.
âœ… Validated JSON formatting before visualization.

ðŸ“Œ Step 4: Building an Interactive Sales Dashboard
With the data ready, I developed an interactive sales performance dashboard using HTML, JavaScript, and Plotly.js.

âœ… Implemented key visualizations:

Credit Health vs Credit Score (Bar Chart)
Age Group vs Churn Rate (Bar Chart with Values)
Gender vs Estimated Salary (Pie Chart)
Age Category vs Tenure (Bar Chart)
âœ… Integrated a file upload feature, allowing users to dynamically visualize their own sales data.
âœ… Enhanced the UI with number formatting (e.g., 5K, 2.5M).


ðŸ“Œ Step 5: Sharing the Project
To make the project accessible, I hosted it on GitHub Pages & Google Drive, allowing anyone to interact with the dashboard.

âœ… Uploaded the sales_dashboard_final.html file to GitHub.
âœ… Shared the live link in my resume and with colleagues.


ðŸŽ¯ Key Takeaways
This project highlights the power of AI-driven data analytics:
âœ… Efficiency: AI tools accelerated data cleaning and transformation.
âœ… Automation: Minimal manual effort was needed for analysis.
âœ… Interactivity: The dashboard provides real-time insights.
âœ… Scalability: The process can be applied to larger datasets.

ðŸš€ AI is redefining the way we work with data!
